-- various ways to insert the data into the table


1. -- Standard INSERT

/* Its a standard insert statement query in which it inserts into the table name Employees with the attributes named EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName and lastly HireDate
and it insert the values given in the values paranthesis 1, 'John', 'Doe', and '2023-01-01' */

INSERT INTO Employees(EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate) VALUES( 1, 'John', 'Doe', '2023-01-01');


2. -- with default values

/* As we have already seen that Employees table consists of four attributs 
but we have given the values for only three attributes and one attribute is empty */

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName) VALUES (2, 'John', 'Smith');


3. -- INSERT multiple rows

/* We can also insert many rows using the insert into query only once
here instead of semi colon we use comma to include the other rows too */

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate) 
VALUES (3, 'Alice', 'John', '2023-01-15'),
	     (4, 'Bob', 'Will', '2023-02-20'),
       (5, 'Eva', 'Brown', '2023-01-25');


4. -- INSERT with SELECT

/* Here we are selecting the rows from NewHires table and inserting them into the Employees
by validating the type and the attributes */

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate) 
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate 
From NewHires;


5. -- INSERT with subquery

/* here in the insert query itself we have added a subquery 
by providing the condition for the HireDate so those satisfy that condition from the TemporaryEmployees table
will be added or inserted into the Employees table */

INSERT INTO Employees(EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName)
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM TemporaryEmplyees
WHERE HireDate >= '2023-01-01';


6. -- INSERT using column 

/* here are using column aliases where the attribute name doesn't match up
like we are saying from the TemporaryEmployees table take the Emp_id attribute and insert those values into the
Employees table with the attribute named EmployeeId */

INSERT INTO Employees(EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName)
SELECT emp_id AS EmployeeID, first_name AS FirstName, last_name AS LastName
FROM TemporaryEmployees;
